        <h5>Offline Invoicing Application<small>December 9, 2011</small></h5>
        <p>We've fixed a number of inheritance issues with dropdown nav, and turned off the JS hooks for that element while we resolve some iOS / Android inconsistencies. Dropdowns will work as expected based on their CSS, but have no special mobile functionality at the moment.</p>

        <p>Added nav bar styles to ui.css including arbitrary-content dropdowns. Added basic support for microformats. Modified how the grid handles phone sizes through margin and padding, and in the process fixed a bug which broke the phone grid when used outside another column.</p>

        <h4>Cloud Hosting</h4>
        <p>This term is actually a contradiction, since in the Cloud there is no hosting. You purchase "pipeline" instead of space, pay for what you use.</p>
        
        <p>The main system and database is a service provided by Salesforce.com, which also includes the Administrative Interface like listings, reports, dashboards , etc</p>

        <p>Each web and mobile application along with API Integration Hubs is hosted on Heroku, a Salesforce.com company that revolutionized the Open Source Community by providing an extremely efficient , scalable and affordable platform to deploy applications in seconds. </p>
    
    
        <p>The code , organized , tested and object oriented is stored in separated repositories; Also in the cloud allowing distributed teams to work on the same projects with out conflicts with 100% reliability.</p>
